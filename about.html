        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I was born and raised in Georgia, so I have lived here all of my life! Currently, I am 21 years of age which to me is wild since I am about to graduate college. Growing up, I played soccer, did ballet, and participated in high school debate. Although I was very active in my younger years, I am still glad I was able to have many different experiences.</p>
        
        <h2>Experiences</h2>
        <p>Since most of my time at KSU has been online, I unfortunately have not had many chances to experience the KSU campuses. However, I have attended a couple of speaking conferences discussing cybersecurity and they have always been a fascinating experience. This website is a result of my desire to try different experiences and build my own site. Hopefully, I can continue to grow my web design skills in the future!</p>
        
        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>Currently, my main goals are to successfully graduate from KSU and secure a full-time job. I have had some success in job hunting, though I have not landed anything quite yet, but I am hopeful that will change soon! Gaining more experience in cybersecurity is also important to me, as one of my long-term goals is to be able to work from home. If I have any kids in the future, working from home will be incredibly beneficial which is why it is a key long-term goal of mine.</p>
