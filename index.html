        <h1>Welcome to My Website!</h1>
        <p>My name is Abbi Mullins and I am working towards my bachelor's in cybersecurity. I am currently studying at Kennesaw State University and plan to graduate soon! I was able to take all of my classes online, which was beneficial since I live far from both of the KSU campuses. Making this website is currently a learning process, so please report any technical issues if needed.</p>
        <p>Thank you for checking out my website!</p>
